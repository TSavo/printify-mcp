## Overview

The Printify MCP Server is a bridge between AI assistants (like Claude) and Printify's print-on-demand platform. It allows AI assistants to create and manage print-on-demand products, generate designs using AI, and handle all aspects of product management through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

MCP is an open standard developed by Anthropic that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). This server implements the MCP specification to expose Printify's functionality to AI assistants in a structured way.

## Features

This MCP server provides the following capabilities:

### Printify API Integration

- **Authentication**: Initialize the Printify API client with your API key
- **Shops**: List and manage Printify shops
- **Products**: Create, read, update, delete, and publish products
- **Catalog**: Browse blueprints, print providers, and variants
- **Images**: Upload images to use in product designs

### AI Image Generation

- **Replicate Integration**: Generate images using Replicate's Flux 1.1 Pro model
- **Combined Workflow**: Generate images with AI and upload them directly to Printify in one step

### Documentation

- **In-Tool Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all aspects of product creation
- **Workflow Guidance**: Step-by-step guides for creating products

### Prompts

- **Generate Product Description**: Generate compelling product descriptions based on product details

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Printify API key
- Replicate API token (for AI image generation)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tsavo/printify-mcp.git
cd printify-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Configuration

You have two options for configuring the environment variables needed by the server:

### Option 1: Using a .env File (Recommended)

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```
PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_printify_api_key
PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id (optional)
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
```

You can use the `.env.example` file as a template by copying it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit the .env file with your actual API keys
```

### Option 2: Using System Environment Variables

Alternatively, you can set these variables directly in your system environment:

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_printify_api_key
set PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id
set REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:PRINTIFY_API_KEY = "your_printify_api_key"
$env:PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID = "your_shop_id"
$env:REPLICATE_API_TOKEN = "your_replicate_api_token"
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
export PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_printify_api_key
export PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
```

The server will check for these environment variables at startup, regardless of whether they're set in a `.env` file or in the system environment.

### Getting a Printify API Key

1. Log in to your Printify account
2. Go to Settings > API
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Copy the API key and add it to your `.env` file

### Getting a Replicate API Token

1. Create an account on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/)
2. Go to your account settings
3. Generate an API token
4. Copy the token and add it to your `.env` file

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the MCP server using the stdio transport, which allows it to communicate with MCP clients like Claude Desktop. The server will automatically initialize the Printify API client using the API key from the environment variable.

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server in development mode with automatic reloading when files change.

## Using with Claude Desktop

There are two ways to use this MCP server with Claude Desktop:
